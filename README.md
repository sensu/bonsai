# Bonsai

Bonsai is Sensu's community repository for assets, currently
hosted at [bonsai.sensu.io](bonsai.sensu.io). 

This is an open source project, with a Ruby on Rails framework. The code is designed to be easy for you to understand and facilitate your contributions. To that end, the goal of this README is to introduce you to the project and get you up and running. 

If you want to contribute to Bonsai Asset Index, read the [contributor's
workflow](https://github.com/sensu/bonsai/blob/update_readme/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for license information and helpful tips to get you started. 

If you have questions, feature ideas, or other suggestions, please [open a
GitHub Issue](https://github.com/sensu/bonsai/issues/new).

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.5.1
- PostgreSQL 9.2+
- Redis 2.4+

## Development

### Setup Using Docker Compose

1. Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/gettingstarted/) are installed locally.

2. In the project root, copy the file .env.example to .env and change the keys and secrets to work in your local environment 
	 (see ENV Variable Descriptions below)
3. Set up at least one Bucket on Amazon S3 as your asset repository, using the IAM policy below, and add the IAM client information to the .env file. (see S3 Buckets and the Minimum S3 IAM Policy below)
4. Set up Github to host Oauth and add the client information to the .env file.  The callback url is: yourhost.com/auth/github/callback (see [https://docs.readme.com/guides/docs/setting-up-github-oauth])
5. From the project root, run "docker-compose build" to create your docker images. (The Postgres and Redis instances will be created by Docker. You do not need to install them locally.)
6. Create the database:  "docker-compose run web rake db:create"
7. Run migrations:  "docker-compose run web rake db:migrate"
8. Run seeds:  "docker-compose run web rake db:seed"
9. Launch app & services: "docker-compose up"
10. The app should now be available at http://localhost:3000
11. (Optional) To run byebug; docker-compose run --service-ports web. Be aware, the background jobs do not run with this operation.
12. (Optional) To run tests; docker-compose run -e "RAILS_ENV=test" web rspec

### ENV Variable Descriptions
The ENV file allows you to customize your environmental variables.  Most work by default, but there are several that are required in order to function properly.  You should copy the env.example file to a file named env and change the variables with your information. The required variables are indicted in the env.example file.

#### Note on Port ENV Variable
The APP_PORT variable in the .env file only indicates to the rails application what port to use in the url in callbacks and redirects. In order to change the port you're using on the device, you need to change it in the .env file and in the docker-compose.yml.  This example sets the port in the docker-compose.yml to 3030:

web:
	ports:
  	- "3030:3000"

### S3 Buckets
You can use two buckets on S3 if you like. The first Bucket is for just release assets (AWS_S3_ASSETS_BUCKET) and the second for everything else (AWS_S3_BUCKET).  If you wish to use only one bucket, use the same bucket name for both env variables.

### Minimum S3 IAM Policy
In the policies tab of Amazon IAM, select Create policy.  Choose JSON instead of visual editor and paste in the following, changing "test-bucket" to the bucket you've created.  Do one for each bucket if you have more than one.
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject",
                "s3:PutObjectAcl"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::test-bucket/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
### Setting up Admin
1. In the rails console find your user record `user = User.find_by(email: "your@email.address")`
2. Add Admin authority `user.roles(:admin)`

### API Documents
Once you have set up the environment and have the application running, you will find the API Docs at [/apidoc](http://localhost:3000/apidoc).

### Example Bonsai Asset on Github
An example of a github asset with annotated bonsai.yml file can be found at [https://github.com/sensu/sensu-slack-handler](https://github.com/sensu/sensu-slack-handler)

### Example of the file structure for hosted assets
TBD

## Production

### Setup on Heroku
You can create the Heroku application via the Heroku CLI or use the app.example.json file in the root to generate it.  You must copy the app.example.json file to app.json and add your ENV variable values before using it.
